# Time Series Analysis of S&P Stock Prices

## Overview

This project analyzes the S&P 500 stock prices using three different time series forecasting models: **ARIMA**, **LSTM**, and **Prophet**. The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle** and the models were implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab**. The results are visualized in an interactive **Power BI** dashboard for further insights.

## Project Features

- **ARIMA Model**: A traditional time series forecasting model that captures trend, seasonality, and noise in the dataset.
- **LSTM Model**: A deep learning model capable of capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.
- **Prophet Model**: A model developed by Facebook for time series forecasting that works well with seasonal data.
- **Visualization**: Power BI dashboard to visualize predictions and actual stock prices across the different models.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), containing daily historical stock prices of the S&P 500.
- **Description**: The dataset contains historical stock prices, with features such as `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, and `Adjusted Close` prices.

Models
ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
The ARIMA model is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to predict future points. It captures autocorrelations in the data to make predictions.

Implementation: The ARIMA model was implemented in a Google Colab notebook, making use of the statsmodels library.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM is a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that excels at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it ideal for time series forecasting.

Implementation: The LSTM model was developed using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries in Python.
File: LSTM Model Implementation
Prophet
Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook. It is designed for time series forecasting with strong seasonal trends and multiple seasonality levels.

Implementation: The Prophet model was implemented using the fbprophet library in Python.
File: Prophet Model Implementation
Visualization
The predictions from the three models were visualized using Power BI. The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations to compare the actual and predicted stock prices.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the models in the Colab notebooks, you will need the following:

Google Colab: All notebooks were designed to run in Google Colab.
Python Libraries:
statsmodels for ARIMA
TensorFlow and Keras for LSTM
fbprophet for Prophet
matplotlib and seaborn for plotting
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Time-Series-S&P-Stock-Analysis.git
Open Google Colab Notebooks:

Open the Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab by following the links to the individual model implementations. You can either run the notebooks directly in Colab or download them to run in your local Jupyter environment.
Run the Models:

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them in Colab using !pip install commands or in your local environment using pip.
Power BI:

Open the Power BI file (sp500_power_bi_dashboard.pbix) in Power BI Desktop to view and interact with the visualizations.
Python Code
ARIMA Model
ARIMA Model: This notebook contains the ARIMA model implementation, using the S&P stock prices dataset to make future predictions.
LSTM Model
LSTM Model: This notebook implements an LSTM model using TensorFlow to predict future S&P stock prices.
